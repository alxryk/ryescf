  <p>This is an account of the Rye Family starting with Solomon Rye I in Dickson County Tennessee. Solomon Rye II was his son. Above is a photo of Solomon Rye II and his wife Elizabeth Williams Rye's home built circa 1830-1840. It was located in Southern Marion County Alabama. It was built out of hand-hewn logs. Unfortunately, this home was burned to the ground by vandals in the 1980's. Solomon and Elizabeth later settled in Monroe County Mississippi in 1850 where Solomon II died in 1855.</p>
